		<p>Hi, I'm Jumailiana</p>
        <br>
		<p>4 year Degree (China) Gov certificed Mandarin Teacher to Foreigners
Joined Dec 2013. From that time offered Chinese. 
Jumai comes from a Chinese family. She's been teach since 
before she graduated with dual degrees in Engineering and 
English. Ubaya.<p>

<p>Not feeling her education was complete, her family sent her 
to take yet another degree -- this time in China. Though 
she'd always grown up with Chinese in the background, she 
hadn't actually learned it formally.</p> 

<p>From 2003-2007 she studied at Hua Wen Shu Yan, a specialised 
teachers college established by Chinese gov where it trains 
CHEFL teachers or Teachers of Mandarin as a Foreign Language.
Full 4year on Scholarship. 
B.A. in teaching Chinese for Foreigners. </p>

<p>Here she got not only the formal training she had lacked 
before, but now also was forced to communicate in Chinese. 
Not just in order to take her lessons </p>

<p>(Unlike in Indonesia, 
there was not Indonesian or English translation. All lesson 
for all subjects, Chinese language, history of hanzi, 
ecconomics, geography, Han culture, caligraphy.teaching 
methodologies -- all were only delivered in Chinese. </p>

<p>To boot, there was no guide or translator. The students also 
had to use Chinese to function in society outside the 
confines of their campus. <p>

<p>While in China, she taught English to small children. Since 
returning from China, she has widened her teaching abilities 
and experience. She taught English in Korea and was  
Assistant Kindergarten teacher at the American International 
School in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  </p>

<p>Upon returning to Indonesia in 2013 she was scouted by a long 
time friend and collegue to join Smart Owl to help it expand 
its offerings and increase its quality. She began by 
establishing /// recruiting teachers the Mandarin program at 
Smart Owl. </p>

<p>Since then, she has helped Smart Owl grow to become the 
Premier In-Home & In-Business Learning Center in East Java. 
She pioneered various quality improvements as well as the 
introduction of Smart Owl's first computer programming 
course, the Android Apps Beginners Class . The class is 
taught by An Android Developer who got his start in tech 
while living in California's Silicon Valley.</p>
